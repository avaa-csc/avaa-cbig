<p>On this web site, you can explore the results of the analyses carried out by <a href="http://cbig.it.helsinki.fi/">the Conservation Biology Informatics Group</a> of <a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en">the University of Helsinki</a>. Results of two extensive analyses are presented: one exploring the global protected area network expansion (GPAN) and other exploring the priority areas for global carnivore conservation (Carnivores). The results have been published in scientific journals on 2014 (GPAN in <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v516/n7531/full/nature14032.html">Nature</a>) and 2016 (Carnivores in <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep23814">Scientific Reports</a>).</p>
